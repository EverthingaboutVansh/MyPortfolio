About me

With over one year of hands-on experience as a Junior UX Designer and Critical Incident Response Analyst, I have a proven track record of leveraging Figma, prompt engineering, web development, Java, MySQL, and the MERN Stack to tackle complex business challenges.

Iâ€™m actively honing my skills on cutting-edge AI models like Deepseekâ€‘r1 and ChatGPTâ€‘o1, blending creative design with robust technical expertise to drive innovation and excellence. Currently, I'm developing AI agents to streamline everyday tasksâ€”excited to bring this passion to groundbreaking projects! ðŸš€ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»
